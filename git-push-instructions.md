# GitHub Push Instructions

Since we need your GitHub credentials to push, please run one of these commands manually:

## Option 1: Using HTTPS (with Personal Access Token)
```bash
git push https://github.com/LittleManMichael/SHAAD.git main --force
```
You'll be prompted for:
- Username: LittleManMichael
- Password: Your GitHub Personal Access Token (not your password!)

## Option 2: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)
First, change the remote URL to SSH:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:LittleManMichael/SHAAD.git
git push origin main --force
```

## Option 3: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)
```bash
gh auth login
git push origin main --force
```

## What this will do:
- Replace ALL content in the GitHub repository with your current local development
- This includes the working Discord bot, frontend, backend, and all documentation

## After pushing, we can:
1. Set up automatic Discord notifications for Git commits
2. Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD
3. Create branch protection rules

Let me know when you've pushed successfully!
